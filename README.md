# Vesuvius ink detection challenge
This repository contains some of the work we did on the [Vesuvius ink detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection). 


**Exploratory data analysis**: While playing around with the default model, we discovered that certain layers were more crucial for ink detection than others. Specifically, the middle layers were found to be more relevant to the ink detection problem. As a result, we sought to investigate this phenomenon further through exploratory data analysis. The notebook is available at [Exploratory data analysis](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb).
